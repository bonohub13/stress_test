# stress_test_for_ubuntu
My home made, custom stress test. Written in Python3 and uses prime numbers for testing.

## ===== TODO ==========
  stress test itself is right below "py3_ver" directory
  
  If you want to do any thing crazy with the prime number generator go to scripts/stress_test.py
  
### ===== Further Plans ==========
#### I am willing to make a cpp version (no point for stress test) in further time as well.
